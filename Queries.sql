/* PostgreSQL PROJECT- MUSIC STORE DATA ANALYSIS */

/* Question Set 1 - Easy */

-- 1. Who is the senior most employee based on job title?
SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEE ORDER By levels DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- 2. Which countries have the most Invoices?
SELECT COUNT(*) AS C,
	BILLING_COUNTRY
FROM INVOICE
GROUP BY BILLING_COUNTRY
ORDER BY C DESC;

-- 3. What are top 3 values of total invoice?
SELECT Round( CAST("total" as numeric), 2) AS "Total" 
FROM invoice
order by total desc
limit 3;

-- 4. Which city has the best customers? We would like to throw a promotional Music 
-- Festival in the city we made the most money. Write a query that returns one city that 
-- has the highest sum of invoice totals. Return both the city name & sum of all invoice 
-- total

SELECT BILLING_CITY,
	Round( CAST(SUM(TOTAL) as numeric), 2) "Invoice_Total"
FROM INVOICE
GROUP BY BILLING_CITY
ORDER BY "Invoice_Total" DESC;

-- 5. Who is the best customer? The customer who has spent the most money will be 
-- declared the best customer. Write a query that returns the person who has spent the 
-- most money

SELECT CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
	CUSTOMER.FIRST_NAME,
	CUSTOMER.LAST_NAME,
	SUM(INVOICE.TOTAL) AS "Total"
FROM CUSTOMER
JOIN INVOICE ON CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = INVOICE.CUSTOMER_ID
GROUP BY CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID
ORDER BY "Total" DESC;

/* Question Set 2 – Moderate */

-- 1. Write query to return the email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock Music 
-- listeners. Return your list ordered alphabetically by email starting with A
-- customer.first_name, customer.last_name, customer.email 

SELECT DISTINCT first_name, last_name, email

WHERE track_id IN(
	SELECT track_id FROM track
	JOIN genre ON track.genre_id = genre.genre_id
	WHERE genre.name LIKE 'Rock'
)
ORDER BY email;

-- 2. Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. Write a 
-- query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands

SELECT artist.artist_id, artist.name, COUNT(artist.artist_id) AS "Number of Songs" FROM track
JOIN album ON track.album_id = album.album_id

JOIN genre ON genre.genre_id = track.genre_id
WHERE genre.name LIKE 'Rock'
GROUP BY artist.artist_id
ORDER BY "Number of Songs" desc
limit 10;

-- 3. Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length. 
-- Return the Name and Milliseconds for each track. Order by the song length with the 
-- longest songs listed first

SELECT name, milliseconds
FROM track
WHERE milliseconds > (
	SELECT AVG(milliseconds) AS avg_track_length
	FROM track
)

/* Question Set 3 – Advance */

-- 1. Find how much amount spent by each customer on artists? Write a query to return
-- customer name, artist name and total spent

-- 2. We want to find out the most popular music Genre for each country. We determine the 
-- most popular genre as the genre with the highest amount of purchases. Write a query 
-- that returns each country along with the top Genre. For countries where the maximum 
-- number of purchases is shared return all Genres

-- 3. Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each 
-- country. Write a query that returns the country along with the top customer and how
-- much they spent. For countries where the top amount spent is shared, provide all 
-- customers who spent this amount
